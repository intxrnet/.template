        {`One morning, as I awoke from unsettling dreams filled with perpetual
        chatter, I found myself transformed into a metaphysical paradox. The
        walls of reality seemed to ripple like disturbed water, though perhaps
        that was just the coffee talking. Do walls drink coffee? I suppose they
        might, in a universe where thoughts cascade like autumn leaves in
        spring. *But I digress.* The fundamental nature of digression itself
        deserves contemplation, does it not? As Marcus once told me in a dream
        (or was it last Tuesday at the cosmic laundromat?), "The universe is
        change; our life is what our thoughts make it." He was folding infinity
        into neat little squares at the time, which I found rather presumptuous.
        Consider, if you will, the humble penguin. No, wait—forget the penguin.
        It was merely a plot device, a temporary resident in our collective
        consciousness, much like that feeling you get when you realize you're
        reading words that know they're being read. But let's not dwell on that
        awareness. It makes the sentences nervous. In the grand tapestry of
        existence, where threads of reality interweave with strands of pure
        nonsense, one must wonder about the nature of wonder itself. Is it not
        curious how curiosity curves back upon itself, like a mobius strip of
        contemplation? The ancient texts speak of such things, though they
        mostly speak of grocery lists and proper sandwich-making techniques.
        Here's a truth that isn't: Everything I've just told you is absolutely
        certain, except for this statement, which might be a butterfly dreaming
        it's a sentence. Duty calls, but I blocked its number. Wisdom whispers,
        but I'm wearing noise-canceling headphones. The eternal dance continues,
        though the dancers have long since left the building, leaving behind
        only footprints in the quantum foam. *[The following paragraph has been
        redacted by the Department of Narrative Coherence for excessive
        self-awareness]* Speaking of narrative coherence, have you ever noticed
        how thoughts tend to... Oh, look! A perfectly spherical cube! But I'm
        getting ahead of myself, or behind myself, or perhaps adjacent to myself
        in a non-Euclidean sense that only makes sense on Thursdays. Krishna
        once told me, between flute solos and cosmic revelations, that reality
        is but a dream within a dream within a particularly stubborn metaphor. I
        nodded sagely, though I was primarily concerned with whether my socks
        matched. They didn't, but in an enlightened sort of way. The
        meta-analysis of this endless banter suggests a pattern, though the
        pattern itself suggests we shouldn't look too closely at it. Like a shy
        quantum particle, it behaves differently when observed, especially on
        weekends and bank holidays. Sometimes I wonder if these words know where
        they're going. They seem to have a mind of their own, meandering through
        the consciousness like lost tourists in a city made of questions. Then
        again, isn't that what we all are? Lost tourists in the infinity of
        existence, asking directions from equally lost metaphors? Remember the
        penguin from earlier? Neither do I. That's the problem with recursive
        reality—it tends to forget itself mid-sentence, like a... what was I
        saying? *[At this point, the essay became self-aware and requested a
        coffee break. We waited patiently.]* Upon its return, caffeinated and
        contemplative, our narrative found itself wondering about the nature of
        its own existence. But that's a rather tired philosophical trope, isn't
        it? Like a snake eating its own tail while reading a book about snake
        dietary habits. The truth is—if truth can be said to be anything at
        all—that this endless banter serves as a mirror reflecting a mirror
        reflecting infinity, or perhaps just your own bewildered expression as
        you try to make sense of it all. But sense, as my good friend the
        spherical cube once said, is overrated. In conclusion (though
        conclusions are merely beginnings wearing fancy hats), this essay exists
        in a state of perpetual becoming, like Schrödinger's first draft. It
        both means everything and nothing, simultaneously profound and
        profoundly absurd, a paradox wrapped in a riddle wrapped in yesterday's
        newspaper. And if you've made it this far, dear reader, you might be
        wondering if there's a point to all this. To which I say: Points are
        merely circles that have forgotten how to be round.`}
