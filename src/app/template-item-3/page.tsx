          Once, a man named Gregor Samsara woke to find he had metamorphosed
          into a giant typewriter. <em>"This is inconvenient,"</em> he clacked,
          ink pooling like existential dread. His therapist, a crow with Marcus
          Aurelius' beard, perched on his spacebar.{" "}
          <strong>"Memento mori,"</strong> the crow squawked,{" "}
          <strong>"but also memento to buy milk."</strong> The typewriter
          groaned. Such is life: half profundity, half grocery lists.

            <strong>YOU:</strong> Why are we here?

            <strong>THE VOID:</strong> To discuss the migratory patterns of
            hypothetical penguins.
            <br />
            <strong>YOU:</strong> That makes no sense.
            <br />
            <strong>THE VOID:</strong> Exactly. Pass the marmalade.

          Meanwhile, Arjuna stood on the battlefield of LinkedIn.{" "}
          <em>"Krishna,"</em> he murmured,{" "}
          <em>"what is my dharma when my network connectivity falters?"</em> The
          divine algorithm chuckled:{" "}
          <strong>"Update your profile picture. The rest is illusion."</strong>{" "}
          Arjuna nodded, uploading a selfie with a filter that made him look
          like a disappointed squid.

          A philosopher once argued that reality is a poorly written sitcom.{" "}
          <strong>"Laugh tracks are the sighs of God,"</strong> he declared,
          before tripping on a metaphor. The audience—a flock of existential
          pigeons—nodded sagely. One pigeon pecked at a scrap of paper that
          read: <em>THIS IS NOT A PLOT.</em> The pigeon ate it. The universe
          continued.

          And so, dear reader<sup>†</sup>, we arrive nowhere. The typewriter
          clatters. The crow quotes Meditations. The penguins waddle toward a
          horizon that's just a sharpie line on a napkin. Banter, you see, is
          the dance of atoms pretending they've something to say. To critique it
          is to critique rain for being wet. To endure it is to… well. Here we
          are. Again.
